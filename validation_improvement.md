Looking at my previous analysis, I need to break down the implementation sequence into smaller, 
more manageable chunks for easier review. Let me think about this carefully...

First, I notice that each planned "wave" is still too large and touches too many components. 
A reviewer would need to understand multiple architectural changes at once. I should make 
the phases more atomic, focusing on one clear concept at a time.

I should also think about dependencies - each phase should build naturally on the previous 
ones without requiring future changes. Like building blocks stacking up.

Looking at the core architecture pattern, we want inside-out development:
1. First establish core domain models and interfaces
2. Then add basic implementations
3. Gradually enhance with more complex features
4. Finally add optimization and advanced capabilities

Hmm... the validation logic is currently scattered across:
- Entity classes with their own validate() methods
- Standalone ValidationRule classes
- Repository validation
- Extension-based validation

We need to carefully migrate this without breaking existing functionality. Each step should 
maintain backwards compatibility.

The phrase "easy for reviewing" makes me think each PR should:
- Focus on a single concept
- Be small enough to understand quickly
- Have clear test coverage
- Not require deep context about future changes
- Allow gradual adoption

Let me break this down into more granular phases:

Phase 1: Core Validation Types (Foundation)
1a. Create new ValidationStrategy enum and config [small]
1b. Enhance ValidationResult with more metadata [small]
1c. Add enhanced ValidationIssue capabilities [small]

Phase 2: Rule System Modernization
2a. Create ComposableRule interface [small]
2b. Add rule combination operators (and/or) [small]
2c. Implement basic rule lifecycle hooks [small]
2d. Add rule registration mechanism [medium]

Phase 3: Context Separation
3a. Create new ValidationState class [small]
3b. Extract caching concerns [small]
3c. Add validation strategy handling [small]
3d. Implement depth/circular detection [medium]

Phase 4: Service Layer Introduction  
4a. Define ValidationService interface [small]
4b. Create basic service implementation [medium]
4c. Add strategy-based validation [small]
4d. Implement service registration [small]

Phase 5: Caching Enhancement
5a. Create dedicated CacheService [small]
5b. Add cache versioning [small]
5c. Implement smart invalidation [medium]
5d. Support partial cache updates [medium]

Phase 6: Entity Validation
6a. Create entity validation hooks [small]
6b. Add fluent validation builder [small]
6c. Implement entity-specific rules [medium]
6d. Add validation events [small]

Phase 7: Extension System
7a. Define extension interfaces [small]
7b. Add extension registration [small]
7c. Create standard lifecycle hooks [small]
7d. Implement extension discovery [medium]

Phase 8: Migration Support
8a. Add backwards compatibility layer [medium]
8b. Create migration utilities [small]
8c. Add validation version support [small]
8d. Implement deprecation notices [small]

Phase 9: Performance Optimization
9a. Add validation batching [medium]
9b. Implement parallel validation [medium]
9c. Add result caching [small]
9d. Optimize rule execution [medium]

Phase 10: Monitoring & Tooling
10a. Add validation metrics [small]
10b. Create debug helpers [small]
10c. Implement validation logging [small]
10d. Add performance tracing [medium]

Key improvements in this approach:
- Each phase has a clear, single focus
- Changes are broken down into very small PRs
- Dependencies flow naturally
- Each step is independently testable
- Maintains backwards compatibility throughout
- Allows gradual adoption of new features

The size indicators [small/medium] help prioritize review resources. Each small change 
should be reviewable in under 30 minutes.

Every PR should include:
- Clear problem statement
- Implementation approach
- Test coverage
- Migration guide (if needed)
- Performance impact (if any)

This gives us a much more manageable path forward. Each change builds confidence gradually 
while maintaining stability. Let me know if this seems like a better breakdown for reviews!
